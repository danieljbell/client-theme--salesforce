<h2>About Digital Transformation<br />Documents Make Digital Transformation a Reality</h2>
<p><em>Digital transformation unlocks the value inside every document and puts your organization on the best path for growth</em></p>
<p>Market leading companies have, for decades, used digital transformation as a competitive differentiator to speed growth, eliminate bottlenecks, and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>By 2021, according to IDC, companies will spend nearly double what they did last year on digital transformation, with the main areas of investment focused on making operations more effective, transforming how people and things communicate, and using information for competitive advantage. What connects each of those areas is the collection of words &mdash; the document &mdash; used to convey relevant business information.</p>
<p>Adding intelligence to documents and related processes is now seen as the next phase of digital transformation because the resulting outcomes are measurable and, most importantly, profitable. Leading companies are using document intelligence to impact desirable outcomes from the very first step, which is where documents define the life of business relationships. Making those documents intelligent also impacts past decisions by increasing the ROI of existing investments, particularly CRM. Both of these impacts help to elevate digital transformation from mere process improvements to strategic, executive-level initiatives.</p>
<p>So where to begin? The digital transformation of documents occurs in three phases:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Transforming how new documents are generated, negotiated, and approved</strong> enables companies to streamline and automate entire processes, from creating sales proposals to generating work orders. It also enables connectivity between documents and systems of record, dramatically reducing workloads through automation and integration.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Document management</strong> includes finding and analyzing documents, then integrating previously hidden data into systems of record. It goes far beyond simple repositories, however, as document-focused artificial intelligence technologies, can now find, classify, and pull context-aware data from deep within documents of all kinds, then make it available for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Turning document intelligence into action</strong> with analysis tools, dashboards, and reports that can connect business outcomes, such as shorter sales cycles, to the language deep within documents and the accompanying document workflows. This level of insight surfaces both incremental and radical opportunities for broad business improvement that remain impossible when documents are treated as disconnected files.</p>
<p>Documents define and connect what happens from the moment a prospect is first engaged through their entire lifecycle as a customer. For most companies, documents are disconnected, which limits the benefits of digital transformation and diminishes any impact on outcomes. Therefore, documents are where executives must focus if they want this next phase of digital transformation to truly energize growth.</p>
<p>Leading companies are spending more money to find more ways to grow and differentiate themselves from the competition. But the gap separating leaders from laggards is widening, and now documents are becoming another differentiator. Which side of the gap are you on?</p>
